    p.hint-text Bolt puts all the typography styles into one place. Simple, powerful. The below header titles are my own custom sizing, I don't tend to like the default sizing and weights of these titles in the browser. There's many other nice features in this stylus file, you should check it out.

    .text-center
      h1 Title h1
      h2 Title h2
      h3 Title h3
      h4 Title h4
      h5 Title h5
      h6 Title h6
